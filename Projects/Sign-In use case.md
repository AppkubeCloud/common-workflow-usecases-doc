system displays an error message informing the employee of the issue and
prompting them to try again.

click on the \"Forgot Password\" hyperlink. The system directs the
employee to the password recovery process, which may include verifying
their identity and allowing them to reset their password.

**Account Registration:** If the employee does not have an account, they
can click on the \"Sign Up\" link. The system directs the employee to
the registration process where they can create a new account.
